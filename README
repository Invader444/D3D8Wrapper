D3D8Wrapper Library
Copyright (C) 2012  Jonathan M. Horowitz

This library provides Direct3D8 interfaces for Direct3D9 implementations.

It is COM-based and tries to keep as close to the original Direct3D8 behavior as possible.

To use this library, you must first create an instance of the IDirect3D8Wrapper interface through
COM (rather than through the Direct3DCreate8 API call). The returned wrapper interface will
have already created an IDirect3D9 interface, which you may get via the GetWrappedInterface function.

Most functions which return an interface have callback functionality, which allows you to register a global
or member function to be called that takes the IDirect3D<Whatever>9* as a parameter. In this way, as a
client calls the wrapper functions, you may be appraised of new interfaces being created on the Direct3D9
side of things.
